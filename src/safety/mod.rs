//! APIs for construction and unwrapping that are checked or unchecked based on the build
//! configuration.
//!
//! This module provides "maybe unchecked" functions for fallible operations. These functions have
//! a `_maybe_unchecked` suffix and mirror `_unchecked` counterparts. When checks are enabled (and
//! so these functions do in fact check), the non-empty guarantee is checked at runtime and so the
//! surface area for potential unsoundness is dramatically reduced. Only unsafe transmutation
//! through transparent types remains (it is unaffected by this module and the build
//! configuration).
//!
//! Functions in this module must always be used just as their `_unchecked` counterparts:
//! invariants must be maintained by callers! The "maybe" merely means that a check may or may not
//! actually occur. This is why `_maybe_unchecked` functions are `unsafe`.
//!
//! Checks are enabled in test builds (i.e., `[#cfg(test)]`) so that bugs manifest as deterministic
//! panics rather than (often silent) undefined behavior. However, checks are **not** enabled for
//! Miri builds (despite also being test builds), because this may prevent Miri from discovering
//! memory safety problems.

// LINT: APIs in this module are pervasive and the set of features that require an item can be
//       volatile and difficult to determine. Dead code is allowed instead, though it requires more
//       careful auditing. Items with a more obvious or simple set of dependent features are
//       annotated with `cfg` or `cfg_attr` when possible. Contrast `OptionExt` with `ArrayVecExt`,
//       for example.
